h3. Demo project for exposing Play! Framework bug.

Application drops HTTP session while render after params.flash() in controller. There must be substantional number of parameters (i.e. form fields) to reveal this bug. 30-40 fields is perfect for this.

So, the recipe is very simple:
* create form with about 40 fields and submit button on index page;
* call params.flash() and render index page in the form action handler.

Affected framework versions: 1.2.5.1, 1.2.6, 1.2.x-1.2.6-14-g9b5db0e.
Not affected: 1.2.5.

Tested on these JREs:
* 1.6.0.45;
* 1.7.0.25.

Tested on these OSes:
* Centos 5.9 i386 (OpenVZ-virtualized);
* Ubuntu 12.04 i386 (KVM-virtualized);
* Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 (KVM-virtualized);
* Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 (baremetal).

Was not tested on Windows.

The most important thing - *this bug is exposed on 32-bit Java only.* There is was no problems with 64-bit Java.

Bug is reproduced in DEV or PROD modes both, so you can launch this app with "play test" or "play run --%prod".
